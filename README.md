# MyFirstMicrogame
My game is a first person shooter that has you go through food themed rooms to shoot drones. The customizations I did were just changing the scenery and adding more eneimes. I added a fruit bowl, Plates and mugs to the main room. I went for a food, or crammed table theme, and used the food models, and the cutlery and plate models I downloaded myself. I tried to set up dining room like areas, with plates, tables and cups. 
To play my game, you have t start play mode on unity. To control movement use use the arrow keys/ WASD. To control the camera angle you move the mouse, and to shoot you right click. 
I learned a lot in this project, I learned how to use prefabs, change material colours, and how to use the assets shop. most of putting together my project went well. I really enjoyed making changes to the scene, and adding all of the prefabs, I did accidentally delete my progress once, but other than hat the process was pretty easy. Putting together this repository was really difficlut, and it took me a long time to actually figure out what I had to do in order to use the folders and add the unity files. I missed class wednesday, so I had to figure it out myself, but after a while I thnk I got it. To be completely honest I am still unsure If I have added everything I needed to.
